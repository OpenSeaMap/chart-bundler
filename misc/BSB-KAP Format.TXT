The BSB/KAP file format.
Tim Thornton from the TeamSurv project has contributed an extended documentation of the bsb/kap file format headers.

http://libbsb.sourceforge.net/


 There is a .BSB file for the chart (not required by OpenCPN and many others), and a .KAP file for each panel within the chart (and an additional optional file for updates to charts, which we won�t use). A header file is required. Create this in the tile folder with file name chartname.bsb.txt and chartname.kap.txt. This has the following formats. In all cases, date is in the format mm/dd/yyyy. Data fields must not have commas in them where there are sub fields, and probably not /. In the NA fields (and possibly others) /A indicates a new line. Subfields can be separated with a �,� or a new line.
 Note that the origin for pixels is the top left (NW) corner of the chart, whereas for positions it is the usual SW corner.
 Tests in OpenCPN have produced a minimum data set requirement for the KAP files. Fields that are required for chart display or for operational reasons have been highlighted in italics in the description. In addition, Raytech requires the BSB file to be present.

The text header is terminated with a <Control-Z><NUL> sequence (ASCII characters 26 and 0). 
Note that where the meaning of a field is the same as in the .BSB file above, it is not repeated here. 
VER - Version number of BSB format � we will use 3.0
BSB (or NOS for older GEO/NOS or GEO/NO1 files) � General parameters 
NA - Pane name 
NU - Pane number. If chart is 123 and contains a plan A, the plan should be numbered 123_A
RA - width, height - width and height of raster image data in pixels 
DU - Drawing Units in pixels/inch (same as DPI resolution) e.g. 50, 150, 175, 254, 300 
KNP � Detailed chart parameters 
SC - Scale e.g. 25000 means 1:25000
GD - Geodetic Datum e.g. WGS84 for us
PR - Projection e.g. MERCATOR for us. Other known values are TRANSVERSE MERCATOR or LAMBERT CONFORMAL CONIC or POLYCONIC. This must be one of those listed, as the value determines how PP etc. are interpreted. Only MERCATOR and TRANSVERSE MERCATOR are supported by OpenCPN.
PP � Projection parameter. For Mercator charts this is where the scale is valid, i.e. +lat_ts � use average latitude of the chart. For transverse Mercator it is the +lon_0 value.
PI � Projection interval ? e.g. 0.0, 0.033333, 0.083333, 2.0 
SP -? � Unknown is valid
SK - Skew angle e.g. 0.0 for us. Angle of rotation of the chart
TA - text angle e.g. 90 for us
UN � Depth units (for depths and heights) e.g. METRES, FATHOMS, FEET 
SD - Sounding Datum e.g. MEAN LOWER LOW WATER, HHWLT or normally LAT
DX � X resolution, distance (meters) covered by one pixel in X direction. OpenCPN ignores this and DY
DY � Y resolution, distance covered by one pixel in Y direction 
CED � Chart edition parameters (see BSB section) 
NTM � Chart edition parameters (see BSB section) 
OST - Offset STrip image lines (number of image rows per entry in the index table) e.g. 1. Generated by imgkap.
IFM - Depth of the colormap (bits per pixel). BSB supports 1 through 7 (2 through 127 max colors). Or compression type? Generated by imgkap.
RGB � Default colour palette - entries in the raster colormap of the form index,red,green,blue (index 0 is not used in BSB). Generated by imgkap. 
DAY � Optional day colour palette 
DSK � Optional dusk colour palette 
NGT � Optional night colour palette 
NGR � Optional night red colour palette 
GRY � Optional grey scale palette
PRC � Optional palette  (palette with reduced colors i.e. 32)
PRG � Optional grey palette     (palette with reduced grayscale i.e. 32)
REF � Reference point record, gives point n, then position x, y in pixels, then in longitude, latitude - optional 
CPH � Phase shift value - optional
WPX � Polynomial longitude to x - optional. The Polynomials is an alternative to REF points for georeferencing. OpenCPN uses these polynomials if they are available. The existence of polynomials is a condition for using noaa:s chart reprojection tool.
PWX � Polynomial x to longitude - optional
WPY � Polynomial latitude to y - optional
PWY � Polynomial y to latitude - optional
ERR � Error record �These should be present if polynomials are used. These ERR rows report the error at the REF points due to the usage of polynomials.
PLY - Border polygon record � coordinates of the panel within the raster image, given in chart datum lat/long. Any shape polygon 
DTM � Datum shift parameters - Datum's northing and easting in floating point seconds to go between chart datum and WGS84 (omitted or 0,0 for WGS84 charts) 
KNQ � Additional parameters - Optional

P3= scale factor for Transverse Mercator; 1st standard parallel for lambert conic
P4= 0 for Transverse Mercator; 2nd standard parallel for lambert conic
P5= Central meridian for Transverse Mercator and lambert conic
P6= origin of latitude for Transverse Mercator and lambert conic
P7 = +x_0 for Transverse Mercator and lambert conic
