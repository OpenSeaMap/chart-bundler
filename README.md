# chart-bundler
The ChartBundler is the a program to bundle all maps which are listed in a catalog into a chart bundle.
It is used to prepare such chart bundles as a downloadable offline chart collection. It is running on our server.

Each bundle is suitable for one application. The first application supported will be OpenCPN (via the kap-file format).

We intend to provide chart bundles for sailing regions. The catalogs have to be designed with the ChartDesigner.
